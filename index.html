        <p>I'm Jose and I'm from Ecuador. This is my first semester at BYU Idaho, I'm studying software engineering.</p>
        <p>About my hobbies, I like to play piano, chess, go to the gym, video games, and watch series.</p>
        <p>I took this course because web development is extremely important in software development, and I would like to learn so that later on, I can do my own projects.</p>
        <p>I have been a member of the church all my li fe.</p>
